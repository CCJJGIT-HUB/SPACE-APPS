<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, We are SeedAxis</h1>
<h3 align="center">In this space we develop a small code using arduino that proposes the monitoring of temperature and humidity as well as the use of led bulbs to visualize the status of our development.</h3>
We identified three major hurdles to the challenge posed: deep-space radiation, volume/mass constraints and the lack of an operational crop system. To address these, we introduce a sophisticated glass that permits only visible wavelength to penetrate and a layer of water is sandwiched between the glasses to further reduce radiation effects. The crop seeds for the system ranges from chillies, duckweed, tomatoes, quinoa, lettuce providing a wide range of nutrients to keep the crew members healthy. Additionally, a protein coating of seeds will allow them to germinate better. To increase autonomy, a programmable mechanical arm that inspects and takes action while monitoring the ecosystem.
